1. Changing default environment name, algorithm, policy of "previous_request.json"

2. Do loading from json when nothing is passed in __init__

3. Currently doing only for PPO

4. The model must be selected by the "loader" based on the highest performing model accoring to the data prenset in logs of that execution number
For now, model_selector selects the lastest model
Statistically return best model

5. Evaluating on differnet environments
	Load must be done on different environment to see how well it could generalize

6. More useful information to be returned from MegaLoader.load()

7. There are a lot of execution numbers where folders are blank, because error happening before writing to the model. This must not happen

8. When we are training our hyperparmeter, we should not do env.render()
	For the time-being I've commented out, that line

9.
